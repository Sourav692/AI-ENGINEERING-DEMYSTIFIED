# 🔍 LangExtract Document Entity Extractor

A Streamlit application that uses Google's LangExtract to transform unstructured text into highlighted, structured information with entity extraction and visualization.

## � About LangExtract

This application is powered by [Google's LangExtract](https://github.com/google/langextract), an open-source library for extracting structured information from unstructured text using large language models.

**LangExtract Official Repository**: https://github.com/google/langextract

## �🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Google Gemini API key

### 1. Navigate to the App Directory

```bash
cd 02_First_Agents/apps/langextract/doc-entity-extractor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using `uv` (recommended):

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using standard pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
```

Or set up Streamlit secrets by creating `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
